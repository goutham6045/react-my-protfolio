      Hi there! My name is Alex. I was born and raised in 
      New York City, surrounded by the bustling energy of 
      the urban landscape. I've always been passionate 
      about technology and how it shapes our world. 
      From a young age, I found myself taking apart 
      old electronics just to see how they worked. This 
      curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer 
      Science, and I'm now working as a software engineer 
      at a tech startup.
      </p>

      When I'm not coding, I love exploring the city's 
      diverse culinary scene â€“ you can often find me trying 
      out new restaurants or attempting to recreate exotic 
      dishes at home. Traveling is another one of my 
      passions; I've been fortunate enough to visit several 
      countries across Europe and Asia, each time immersing 
      myself in different cultures and making lifelong 
      memories.
